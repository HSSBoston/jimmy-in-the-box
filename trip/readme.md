# Winners' Trip to NASA

We are invited to Winners' Trip, which NASA organized in March 2023. It is to visit NASA Headquarters in Washington DC, tour the Wallops Flight Facility and view the launch of a spacecraft to International Space Station.

We run a [fundraiser](https://www.gofundme.com/f/jimmy-in-the-box) from December 2021 to September 2022 to cover the cost of our trip to NASA. Thank you, donors, for your generous support! We will report you our trip!!!
