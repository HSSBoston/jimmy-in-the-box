## Telescope Model Prototypes

We made 3 prototypes in this project.

### Prototype 1

This prototype models JWST's primary mirror with an origami tessellation. See this page for more details about it.

This prototype also models JWST's [Secondary Mirror Support Structure (SMSS)](https://news.northropgrumman.com/news/features/nasas-james-webb-space-telescope-secondary-mirror-deploys-for-the-first-time-using-the-spacecraft-flight-electronics), which uses 3 arms to deploy the secondary mirror. The arms are modeled with bamboo skewers, which are attached to the primary mirror with the hinges made with paper tape and plastic straws. Just like JWST's arms, our arms fold toward the primary mirror (so that they can reduce their volume and can be placed in a rocket) and unfold to form a tripod (so that the secondary mirror can stay at a distance from the primary mirror).

JWST's sun shield is modeled with sheet protectors. Five layers of sheet protectors are connected with foundation bars with strings.



### Prototype 2




### Prototype 3

This prototype models JWST's primary mirror and sunshields with origami crafts. They are attached to two snake cubes, which model JWST's bottom foundation parts.
