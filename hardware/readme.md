## Required Hardware

- Raspberry Pi (Raspi) Zero WH ([Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3708), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-Zero-WH-Pre-soldered/dp/B07B8MMD3V/))
  - You also need a Micro SD card ([Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2693), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073K14CVB/)) and a power supply cable ([Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1995), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Raspberry-Power-Supply-Adapter-Charger/dp/B08523DFR4/)).
  - We used a case for Raspi Zero ([Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4822), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Flirc-Raspberry-Pi-Zero-Case/dp/B08837L144)), but this is optional.
- Camera for Raspi
  - Either Version 2 ([Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Arducam-Raspberry-Official-Megapixel-Acrylic/dp/B083FNFPF2/)) or Version 1 ([Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Arducam-Megapixels-Sensor-OV5647-Raspberry/dp/B012V1HEP4/)) is fine.
- Camera cable ([Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5211), [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T8TLCFZ/))
  - Used to connect a camera and Raspi Zero. This has to be compatible with Raspi Zero. The default Raspi camera cable does not fit with Zero. (It is for other Raspi models than Zero.)
- GPS receiver
  - You can use any GPS receivers that can do TTL serial communication.
  We have used [this](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PRDY6DS/) and [this](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D1D0F5M/) receivers. The former requires soldering to connect a receiver board and pins. The latter does not. You can choose [this one](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B078Y6323W/) too. It integrates a magnetometer (compass) with a GPS receiver.
- Push button
  - We used [this one](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1333). Anything similar should work, but we have not used any others.
