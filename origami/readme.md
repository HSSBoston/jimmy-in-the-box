# Origami Crafting

We made 2 origami crafts.

## Hexagonal Tessellation (Primary Mirror)

JWST's primary mirror has 19 hexagonal segments. One of them in the middle is to mount the camera (in black). The others in gold are mirror segments. We modeled this mirror in hexagonal segments as an origami tessellation. Tessellation is a tiling technique to repeat patterns on a plane by folding a single sheet of paper.

We started with [Eric Gjerde](https://www.ericgjerde.com/)’s [hexagonal tessellation](https://www.ericgjerde.com/portfolio/spread-hexagons/) ([book](https://www.amazon.com/Origami-Tessellations-Awe-Inspiring-Geometric-2008-12-03/dp/B01F81MLZW/), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BTu2Hih39A)). It is elegant, but not that similar to JWST's primary mirror because hexagons overlap to spread. (See below.)

So, we customized the folding strategy to better model primary mirror.





## Long Hexagon (Sun Shield)

JWST's sunshield has 5 layers of long hexagons.
