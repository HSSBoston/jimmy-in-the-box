# Origami Crafting

We made 2 origami crafts.

## Hexagonal Tessellation (Primary Mirror)

JWST's primary mirror has 19 hexagonal segments. One of them in the middle (black-colored) is to mount the camera. The others in gold are mirror segments. We modeled this mirror in hexagonal segments as an origami tessellation.

We started with [Eric Gjerde](https://www.ericgjerde.com/)â€™s [hexagonal tessellation](https://www.ericgjerde.com/portfolio/spread-hexagons/) ([book](https://www.amazon.com/Origami-Tessellations-Awe-Inspiring-Geometric-2008-12-03/dp/B01F81MLZW/), [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BTu2Hih39A)). It is elegant, but not that similar to JWST's primary mirror.


Elegant, but not that similar because hexagons overlap to spread.
Customized the folding strategy to better model primary mirror.





## Long Hexagon (Sun Shield)
